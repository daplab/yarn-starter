YARN Starter
====

[YARN](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html), aka NextGen MapReduce, is awesome for building fault-tolerant distributed applications. 
But writing [plain YARN application](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/WritingYarnApplications.html) 
is far than trivial and might even be a [show-stopper to lots of engineers](http://www.edwardcapriolo.com/roller/edwardcapriolo/entry/yarn_either_it_is_really).

The good news is that a framework to simplify interaction with YARN emerged and joined the Apache foundation: [Apache Twill](http://twill.incubator.apache.org/). 
While still in the incubation phase, the project looks really promising and allow to write (easier to test) 
[Runnable](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html) application and run them on YARN.

The goal of this project is to reduce the entry barrier of writing fault-tolerant YARN applications, mostly leveraging on Twill 
([version 0.5.0-incubating](http://twill.incubator.apache.org/apidocs-0.5.0-incubating/index.html) at the time of writing).
Read more on Twill [here](http://blog.cask.co/2014/01/programming-with-apache-twill-part-ii/),

# Simple Twill App Example

[SimpleTwillTest](src/test/java/ch/daplab/yarn/twill/SimpleTwillTest.java) is a really trivial application deployed on YARN using Twill. The application basically prints out 
a "hello world"-like message and quits.

The SimpleTwillTest test class extends [AbstractTwillLauncher](src/test/java/ch/daplab/yarn/twill/AbstractTwillLauncher.java) which takes care of 
starting an embedded [Zookeeper](https://github.com/kafka-dev/kafka/blob/master/core/src/test/scala/unit/kafka/zk/EmbeddedZookeeper.scala) 
server as well as a [MiniYARNCluster](https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/MiniYARNCluster.java).


# Multiple Runnable Twill App Example

With Twill you can run several different [TwillRunnable](https://github.com/apache/incubator-twill/blob/master/twill-api/src/main/java/org/apache/twill/api/TwillRunnable.java). 
This example runs 2 different applications:
* 1 [Producer](src/test/java/ch/daplab/yarn/twill/worker/Producer.java), which will produce random number in an [embedded redis](https://github.com/kstyrc/embedded-redis) 
    server (via [rpush](http://redis.io/commands/rpush) command). The producer announce the redis instance via the 
    [Twill Service Discovery](http://twill.incubator.apache.org/apidocs/org/apache/twill/discovery/package-summary.html) feature.
* 3 [Consumer](src/test/java/ch/daplab/yarn/twill/worker/Consumer.java)s, which will discover the redis instance and start reading the messages 
    (via [blpop](http://redis.io/commands/blpop) command).


# Fault Tolerant Twitter Ingestion Twill App

## Twitter to HDFS

Leveraging on the two previous example, this Twill application is reading data from Twitter firehose using [Twitter4j](http://twitter4j.org/) 
and storing the data into HDFS.

Twitter4j has been wrapped as an [RxJava Observable](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observable.OnSubscribe.html) object, 
and is attached to and HDFS sink, partitioning the data by yyyy/mm/dd/hh/mm. This will be useful to create hive tables 
later on, with proper partitions.

### Configure it

Action Required: to be able to run the application, you need to [register a Twitter application](http://iag.me/socialmedia/how-to-create-a-twitter-app-in-8-easy-steps/)
to obtain oauth credentials. Store the credentials in the [twitter.properties config file](src/main/resources/twitter.properties).
Also, you might want to run  ```git update-index --assume-unchanged src/main/resources/twitter.properties``` to avoid committing your credentials.

### Build it

```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

Note: `-DskipTests` is optional, but will make the build faster.

### Run it

And Run it in the [DAPLAB](http://daplab.ch) infrastucture like this:

```
./src/main/scripts/start-twitter-ingestion-app.sh --zk.connect daplab-wn-22.fri.lan:2181 --root.folder /tmp/$(whoami)/twitter
```

By default data is stored under `/tmp/twitter/firehose`, monitor the ingestion process:
```
hdfs dfs -ls -R /tmp/twitter/firehose
...
-rw-r--r--   3 yarn hdfs    7469136 2015-04-24 09:59 /tmp/twitter/firehose/2015/04/24/07/58.json
-rw-r--r--   3 yarn hdfs    6958213 2015-04-24 10:00 /tmp/twitter/firehose/2015/04/24/07/59.json
drwxrwxrwx   - yarn hdfs          0 2015-04-24 10:01 /tmp/twitter/firehose/2015/04/24/08
-rw-r--r--   3 yarn hdfs    9444337 2015-04-24 10:01 /tmp/twitter/firehose/2015/04/24/08/00.json
...
```

That's it, now you can kill the application and see how it will be restarted by YARN!


## Twitter to Kafka

Another version of the `TwitterTo` application is available: it reads from Twitter and publishes into Kafka.
This version is slightly lighter than the toHDFS version as it's not a Twill application.

The build and configure steps are the same than before, except that the topic must be created before running the application.

```
kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper daplab-wn-22.fri.lan:2181 --create --topic $(whoami)_twitter --partitions 2 --replication-factor 2
```

### Run it
```
./src/main/scripts/start-twitter-ingestion-app.sh --zk.connect daplab-wn-22.fri.lan:2181 --broker.list daplab-rt-11.fri.lan:6667,daplab-rt-13.fri.lan:6667,daplab-rt-14.fri.lan:6667 --topic.name $(whoami}_twitter
```

### Check if some tweets are flowing into  Kafka

```
/usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-run-class.sh kafka.tools.GetOffsetShell --broker-list daplab-rt-11.fri.lan:6667,daplab-rt-13.fri.lan:6667 --topic  $(whoami)_twitter --time -1
```
